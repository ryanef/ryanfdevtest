Astro is a JavaScript framework great for content-driven websites like blogs but it is also very flexible with integrations(https://astro.build/integrations) for JavaScript libraries such as React, Prisma ORM and e-commerce plug-ins . For this project, we will stick to Astro's static site generator features and deploy a fast loading blog on AWS.

To begin:
- AWS Account with Administrator Access
- Terraform installed
- Node 18+
